          <h2>Step 1</h2>
          <p>In class, I learned about hand recognition. To explore more functionality, I chose to do a coding for body pose.</p>

          <h2>Step 2</h2>
          <p>I started by setting some points to recognize the contours of the body.

          <h2>Step 3</h2>
          <p>After determining the location of the dots, I used the connections to create more visible body parts.</p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>That's when I ran into a problem. My pre-loaded music wouldn't play. I copied the URL directly and it had no effect.</p>

      <h2>How I solve this problem</h2>
      <p>I have to upload local files to p5js to get the system to detect and play them.</p>

    <h2>NO CHATGPT!</h2>
    <p>I want to control the music playing through body movements.
        I couldn't find a suitable tutorial for this and I chose to use chatgpt, 
        but the code given by chatgpt is not only complicated but also doesn't achieve the effect I want.</p>

    <h2>Another Way to go</h2>
    <p>In class, we find a new way out. It's so simple and easy. We set up a trigger point so that it can detect my pose.</p>
